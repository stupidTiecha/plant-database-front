            The database contains fully referenced, detailed information on how M&#257;ori used
            plants to survive in New Zealand, particularly before the arrival of Europeans.
            Material relating to later economic uses of native plants is recorded too, though
            generally not on timber uses and the kauri gum trade.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Fungi and seaweeds are included, and there are references to some Pacific plants,
            such as Pandanus, that have links to M&#257;ori culture.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Also included are pertinent references on traditional resource rights and intellectual
            property claims relating to plant uses by indigenous peoples.</p>

        <p class="text">
            The information is taken from the written record, mostly published (books, articles,
            newspapers) and some unpublished (such as manuscripts and letters).

        <p class="text">
            Sources are noted for each item. Information is generally recorded as written in
            the source material, without interpretation. Editorial comment is sometimes made
            for clarification.</p>

            Te Taura Whiri i te Reo M&#257;ori (the M&#257;ori Language Commission) suggested
            this name for the database. Ng&#257; tipu are the plants (literally, growing shoots);
            in this context, whakaoranga means &quot;to provide the livelihood, or to sustain&quot;
            &mdash; thus, the plants that sustain us.</p>
